# Ecommerce Shipping Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Ecommerce shipping processes often suffer from inefficiencies, leading to delayed deliveries and increased operational costs. This project aims to enhance delivery time predictions using machine learning techniques, helping ecommerce platforms provide accurate shipping estimates and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Accurate Delivery Time Predictions**: Predict whether a shipment will be delivered on time using machine learning algorithms.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Provide reliable delivery estimates to improve customer trust and satisfaction.
- **Reduction of Delivery Delays**: Anticipate potential delays caused by factors like traffic, weather, and carrier-specific issues.
- **Optimization of Shipping Logistics**: Reduce inefficiencies and lower operational costs for ecommerce businesses.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The project utilizes machine learning models trained on historical and real-time data to predict delivery times accurately. The approach includes:
- Data preprocessing (handling categorical variables, outliers, and imbalances using SMOTE).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns.
- Model selection and comparison (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Ridge Classifier, KNN, Random Forest, SVM).
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- Selection of the best model for prediction.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle (E-Commerce Shipping Data)
- **URL**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics/data)
- **Size**: 431 KB (CSV format)
- **Features**: Shipping mode, customer details, product specifics, discounts, etc.

## 🏗️ Model Development
### 🔹 Feature Selection
Selected features include:
- **Warehouse Block, Mode of Shipment, Customer Care Calls, Customer Rating, Cost of Product, Prior Purchases, Product Importance, Gender, Discount Offered, Weight in gms.**

### 🔹 Machine Learning Models Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Logistic Regression with Cross Validation (LogisticRegressionCV)
3. XGBoost Classifier
4. Ridge Classifier
5. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
6. Random Forest Classifier
7. Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM)

### 🔹 Final Model Selection
- **Chosen Model**: Random Forest
- **Reason**: Achieved the highest accuracy (68.42%) and high precision (93.00%), ensuring reliable predictions while minimizing overfitting.

## 🚀 Deployment
- The model is integrated into a web-based system where users can input shipment details and receive delivery time predictions.
- The UI provides an easy way for users to enter shipment data and view results.
